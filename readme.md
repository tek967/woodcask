# WDE

WebDisplayEngine or simply WDE is an iOS / macOS app which will load a website with WebKit and things like a loading bar.
It creates an illusion of a native app without it actually being one.
This is a more space-saving solution for people who wants to build a mobile app but dont want to make another UI just for the app where they can just load a website which is already (Should have) quite polished.

This is open source and anyone can fork it.
No liscense cuz noone cares!

Build it yourself, its not hard!
